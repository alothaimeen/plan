After you finish reading, write the effect that each important event had. Look at the pictures of the events. Which one do you think has affected the world the most? Discuss with a partner.The world is constantly going through changes. Look at some important events that have changed the world and affected the lives of many people in modern times.The UnificaTion of The Kingdom of SaUdi arabiaKing Abdulaziz, a gifted leader, was responsible for the legendary event that marked the beginning of modern Saudi Arabia. In 1902, he regained Riyadh, beat the city garrison, took the Masmak Fortress, and established his headquarters in the city. He expanded Saudi Arabia to include all of the Hijaz, Makkah and Madinah and united all the tribes. On September 23, 1932, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was officially established, with Arabic as the national language and the Holy Qur’an as its constitution. King Abdulaziz initiated the building of infrastructure and set Saudi Arabia on the road to modernization.The UniTed arab emiraTeS - UaeThe federation of the United Arab Emirates, known as UAE, consists of seven sheikhdoms; Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras Al-Khaimah, Sharjah and Umm Al Quwain. The city of Abu Dhabi in Abu Dhabi is the capital. The UAE was officially established in 1971. It came after the discovery of enormous oil reserves in Abu Dhabi in 1958. The UAE dirham, a single national currency, was launched in 1973. The oil revenues as well as income from other commercial activities have been used to develop a thriving economy and social infrastructure. Abu Dhabi now hosts its own grand prix at Yas Marina Circuit and Dubai is home to the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa.The Space raceThe Russians launched the world’s first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, on October 4, 1957. Next, Sputnik 2 went up into space on November 3. The Americans won the race to land on the moon more than ten years later—with Apollo 11 on July 20, 1969. “This is one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind,” said astronaut Neil Armstrong, the first person to walk on the moon. His Royal Highness Prince Sultan bin Salman Al Saud flew on STS-51G Discovery in June 1985 as the representative of the Arab Satellite Communications Organization (ARABSAT). He was the youngest person to fly on the Space Shuttle at the age of 28.*The commUnicaTionS revolUTionThe first communications satellite, called Telstar, was launched from Cape Canaveral on July 10, 1962. This marked the start of rapid transmission of TV signals over wide areas. What we take for granted today—satellite television, cellular telephones, wireless and high-speed Internet connections, and so forth—were part of science fiction only 40 years ago. Teenagers today are the first real citizens of the digital world. Unlike their parents, they have grown up in a world in which electronic delivery of information and entertainment is natural and more accepted than conventional forms like the newspaper, tape, or film. *  Adapted from: Wikipedia contributors.

Warm Up

With books closed, write the following words/phrases on
the board and ask students what they know about them.
Tell them to help each other in pairs.
overpopulation
endangered species
space exploration
Ask: What have you read or seen on TV about these
issues?  Which issues are positive and which are
negative in your opinion? Are there any other changes
that have impacted our world significantly?
Encourage students to discuss the questions in small
groups and report back on their group discussion. Discuss
as a class the global changes they feel are the  most
significant.

1 Listen and Discuss

a  Have students look at the pictures on page 6. Read

the title aloud: Big Changes. Tell them that by looking
at the pictures and the captions quickly they can make
guesses about what “big changes” means here. Give
students a few minutes to look at the pictures and scan
the article.

a   To activate prior knowledge and vocabulary, ask

students to discuss what they see. For example, ask:
What is each photo of? (The Saudi flag; the UAE flag, a
spacecraft; a communication satellite)
Where is the Masmak Fortress ? (in the center of
Riyadh)
Why was it important for King Abdulaziz to
conquer it? (because it allowed him to establish his
headquarters in Riyadh and take more areas)
What does UAE stand for? (United Arab Emirates)
What was the Space Race? (a race to see who could
land on the moon first)
What countries were involved? (the United States and
the Soviet Union)

How do you think satellites created a
communications revolution? (Signals could be
transmitted very quickly.)

|  Play the audio as students listen only.
|   Play the audio again as students follow

along in their books. Pause after each segment
to check comprehension.

a  Ask questions, such as the following:

Why was Apollo 11 important? (U.S. won the race)
What happened in 1902? (King Abdulaziz marched
into Riyadh and took the Masmak Fortress)
When was the UAE established? (in 1971)
What happened in the UAE in 1973? (The UAE dirham
was launched as a national currency)
When was Sputnik I launched? (October 4, 1957)
What was significant about Sultan Salman
Abdulaziz Al Saud? (He was the youngest person to
fly on the space shuttle at the age of 28)
What was Telstar? (the first communications satellite)

a  Ask students to work in pairs to check the most

important event in each text, and write the effect that
each important event had. Check answers as a class by
calling on students.

a  Allow a few minutes for students to ask about any
words or phrases that are unfamiliar to them.

Language Builder
Write on the board the famous quote by Neil Armstrong
when he took his first step on the moon: “This is one
small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.”
Explain that a leap is a big jump or a big advancement.

Global Issues
a  Direct students’ attention to page 7. Read the title aloud:
Global Issues. Ask students to look at the pictures and
describe what they see, either in pairs or as a class.

|   Play the audio for the list of global issues. Have

students listen and follow along.

a  Tell students to scan the list of global issues, and to ask

about any unfamiliar words.

a  Have students work alone to mark the global issues

they think affect us the most.

a  Tell students to write a fact for each issue they chose

and an effect for that fact.

a  On the board, draw 3 columns with the headings, Issue,
Fact, Effect. After several minutes, call on one student
from each group to report to the class and write their
choices on the board.

Quick Check

 A
a  Read the directions. Suggest to students that if they

are unsure of the correct answer, they should use the
context on page 6 to help them.

a  Have students work individually to complete

the activity.

a  Have students check answers in pairs. Then, check

answers as a class.

2 Pair Work
a  Go over the directions together.
|   Play the audio of the conversations. Students listen

and follow along in their books.

|   Play the audio again. Students listen and repeat.
a  Organize students into pairs. Tell them to take turns

asking and answering the questions. Allow a set time for
the activity (about eight minutes) or tell students to ask
a specific number of questions (maybe five). For some
students, having parameters makes it easier for them to
engage in and finish the activity.

Workbook

Assign page 219 for practice with the vocabulary of the unit.

Teaching Tip
When one student is reporting to the class, students sometimes
see this as a time to relax. By giving the whole class a task to do
that involves listening to the student who is reporting, everyone
stays involved in active learning. They are encouraged to focus
if they know they must use what they hear. This also helps them
develop the skill of listening for a purpose.
Additional Activity
Divide students into groups. Have each group choose one of the
global issues from page 7 and come up with a list of ideas of how
to address it. Have groups share their ideas with the class.

facts

The Space Race. The first person in space was Yuri
Gagarin of the Soviet Union. He went into space aboard the
Vostok on April 12, 1961 and orbited Earth for 108 minutes.
On February 20, 1962, John Glenn became the first American to
successfully orbit Earth. Who won the space race? The Russians
said they did because they launched the first man into space,
whereas the United States claimed they did because they put
the first man on the moon.

Workbook

Assign pages 220–222 for more practice with the grammar
of the unit.

Teaching Tip
Try to adapt material to make it relevant to students. For example,
because this is the first unit, it is important for students to get
to know each other and feel comfortable in the class. Have
students spend a few minutes sharing a little about themselves,
using the grammar points. For example: I am from Abha. I go
to a private school in Abha. I have two brothers. They are
working in New York.
Additional Activity
Activity 1: In pairs, have students take turns making statements
about your school or your class. If the statement is true, the
partner responds True. If the statement is false, the partner
responds False and then corrects the statement to make it true.
Activity 2: Have students work in small groups to play a
guessing game. Students take turns making a statement about
a classmate. The rest of the group tries to guess who it is. Since
this is the first unit, students may not be familiar enough with
each other to talk about daily habits, but can focus on physical
attributes, or what classmates are wearing. For example:
A:  He is wearing a T-shirt that says…
B:  Is it (name)?
A:  Yes, it’s (name).

5 Listening

a  Direct students’ attention to the photo. Ask them to
describe what they see. To activate prior knowledge
and help students predict what they will hear, ask
questions. For example:

  Where did people emigrate from?
  Why did they immigrate?
  What was at Ellis Island?

 How do you think people felt when they saw the
Statue of Liberty?
 Not everyone was allowed to enter the U.S. Why do
you think they wouldn’t let some people enter?
|   Play the audio as students listen. Check general

understanding by repeating the first three questions
above. Have students read the questions.

answers. Play the audio a third time for students to
check their answers.

a  Call on students for the answers. Ask them to correct

the false statements to make them true.

|  Audioscript

For centuries, people have made major changes in their lives.
Many have moved to other countries in search of new lives. One
of the great periods of immigration was between 1880 and 1920.
At that time, 23 million immigrants arrived in the United States.
Most of them came from poor towns and villages in Southern
and Eastern Europe. They had one thing in common: They
believed that in the United States life was going to be better for
them. It was the land of freedom and prosperity.

1 Big Changes

Most of these immigrants were able to get just enough money to
pay for the trip across the ocean by boat. Many arrived without
any money to their names. Often the father of a family came first
and found work. Then he sent for his wife and children.
The trip across the ocean for poor immigrants was terrible.
Men, women, and children stayed in crowded and smelly
compartments, deep down in the hold of the ship. They had
no showers, and there were no dining rooms for them. They
went up on deck to get food from huge pots. This was the
price they had to pay to get to the “New World.”
On their arrival in the United States, they saw the Statue of
Liberty in New York Harbor. But they weren’t free to enter
America right away. When immigrants landed in New York,
ferryboats took them to Ellis Island, where immigration officers
questioned the new arrivals, and doctors examined them.
Those who failed the medical exam had to go back to their
native countries. Sometimes if a child was ill, the entire family
had to return. Ellis Island became known as “Heartbreak Island”
among immigrants.

8 Conversation

a  Tell students to look at the photos. Ask: What do you

think this conversation will be about?

|   Play the audio. Have students listen and follow along

in their books.

Your Turn
a  Go over the directions and the information to include in

their role play. Review the phrases used to start
the conversation (Tell me about yourself) and to
keep it going (How about you? What do you do? Do
you miss…?).

a  Have students practice the conversation with a partner.

a  Evaluate the general proficiency level of your class. If

Then they switch roles and practice again.

Real Talk
a  Model the phrases for students to repeat.
a  Ask: Who says in fact and You see in the

conversation? (Saud) Why does he add these?
(Because it’s surprising that he’s from Dubai, but his
grandparents are also from Berlin; so he has
a German passport)

a  Who says by the way? (Hans) Why does he say

this? (He’s changing the topic to talk about jobs.) Who
says fit in? (Saud)

a  Have students work with their partner to practice these
phrases. Tell them to talk about a topic from the unit,
and have the partner interrupt and change the topic
using by the way.

a  Have students discuss what it takes to fit in in various

situations; for example, at school, at work, in sports, or at
a party. Call on volunteers to share their ideas.

About the Conversation
a  Have students work with a partner to ask and answer

the questions.

a  Call on one student to ask a question of another

student. The student who answers then asks the next
question of a different student.

Answers

Answers will vary. Sample answers:

1.  They are from Leipzig, Germany.

2.

 His family has been in the western part of Germany since soon
after the reunification.

3.  No, he hasn’t.

4.

 He’s allowed to work legally in Germany because his
grandparents were from Germany.

5.  No, he isn’t. He is happy in Germany.

you decide they need support forming questions using
what’s in the book, write examples on the board. For
example: Where were you born? Where were your
grandparents from? Do you still have relatives in
those places? What languages do your parents/
grandparents speak? What do your parents do?
What did your grandparents do?

a  Have students practice the role play. Encourage them

not to look at the conversation as they practice.
a  Have pairs present their role play for the class.

Workbook

.

Assign page 223 for additional reading practice.

Teaching Tip
Although it is easy to have students form pairs with classmates
sitting near them, students benefit from working with various
partners. Students can be paired in a variety of ways. For example,
ask them to work with the person on their left, their right, in
front of them, behind them, or someone they’ve never worked with
before.
Additional Activity
Have students work in pairs. They choose a country to be from
and make up information about themselves and their family using
the list in Your Turn. Encourage them to create any details they
want to make it an interesting family. Then have them form new
pairs, and take turns talking about their make-believe selves and
families.

facts

About 12 million immigrants passed through Ellis Island
in New York between 1892 and 1954. Immigration officials
were strict about who they let in. Questions, such as Do you
have more than $30 with you? Are you able to read and write?
Are you going to join a relative? were asked on the ship on the
way over. These same questions were asked again once they
arrived. Officials compared the answers to make sure that
the passengers were telling the truth.

12All successful changes start with a vision. Successful visions are based on strong pillars. The first pillar of our vision is our status as the heart of the Arab and Islamic worlds. We recognize that Allah the Almighty has given to our country, a gift more precious than oil.  Saudi Arabia is the Land of the Two Holy Mosques, the most sacred sites on earth and the direction of the Kaaba (Qibla) to which more than a billion Muslims turn at prayer. We will expand and further develop our country to ensure that that Muslims from around the world can visit the Holy Sites.The second pillar of our vision is our determination to become a center for global business.  We will develop the economy to encourage investment from other countries and international businesses.The third pillar is transforming our unique geographical location into a global hub connecting three continents, Asia, Europe and Africa.  We will use our geographical position to improve trade and transport to and from our country.Although our country is rich in its natural resources, our real wealth lies in the ambition of our people and the potential of our younger generation. They are our nation’s pride and the architects of our future.  We will support young people in finding jobs and training. Our vision is built around three themes: A vibrant society, a thriving economy and an ambitious nation. The first theme is vital to achieving the vision. We believe in the importance of a vibrant society. Members of this society live in accordance with the Islamic principle of moderation, are proud of their national identity and their ancient cultural heritage, enjoy a good life, are protected by caring families and are supported by a social and health care system.  The government is committed to supporting  families and the education and wellbeing of their children. In the second theme, a thriving economy provides opportunities for all by building an education system that meets the needs of the market. It creates economic opportunities for small enterprises as well as large corporations. Therefore, we will develop and diversify our economy to create job opportunities. Our third theme-an ambitious nation-is built on a responsible, transparent and high-performing government. We will apply efficiency and responsibility at all levels.We will also prepare the right environment for our citizens, businesses and society to be responsible and take the initiative in facing challenges and seizing opportunities.We are confident about Saudi Arabia’s future. With all the blessings Allah has given us, we cannot help but be optimistic about the decades ahead. The future of our country is one of huge promise and great potential. Our precious country deserves the best. Our vision, grounded in our country’s strengths, will deliver this stability and create a brighter future for our country and our people.Progress towards the future 1 Big Changes9 Reading   Before Reading  Think about Saudi Arabia’s progress and growth since its foundation in 1932 until now.   • What are the most significant advances or changes?   • How do you think these will develop or progress in the future?  *  Adapted from the text of the Vision Programs at https://vision2030.gov.sa/en and from the text that was drafted by the Council of Economic and Development Affairs as instructed by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud.MG_01_COMBO_TEXT_2025.indb   12MG_01_COMBO_TEXT_2025.indb   1229/4/25   1:55 AM29/4/25   1:55 AM1 Big Changes

What are some of the important parts of each
theme? (answers will vary)

Arabia? (yes)
What words or phrases did you use as clues to
decide this? (answers will vary but can include:
successful, determination, our nation’s pride,
committed, opportunities for all, responsible, high-

a  In pairs, have students share the unknown words they
had underlined while listening and have them try to
work out the meaning from the context.

9 Reading
Before Reading
a  Read through the Before Reading questions together.
a  Ask students to consider the questions individually and
to make notes about the issues in any format they wish.

a  Encourage them to use  charts, lists, mind-maps or

different colors to figure out what formats for recording
and organizing information and ideas work best for
them.

a  Tell them that they will share these ideas later.

READING STRATEGY Predicting

Take a few minutes to have students consider what
they usually do when they’re about to read something
unfamiliar. Ask: When you open a new book or
magazine, what do you do first? Do you just start
reading, or do you like to look at the pictures, the title,
or maybe a few sentences first? Elicit responses and
then say: These all give some clues to what the reading
is about. It’s always good preparation to look over
these obvious clues before we begin to read.
|   Play the audio. Ask students to read along

as they listen. Have students underline any unknown
words as they listen.
Reassure them that they do not need to know every
word in order to understand the text and that many
unknown words will become clear from the context.

a  Have students reread the text, one paragraph at a
time. Pause regularly, and ask questions to check
understanding of the main ideas. For example:
What is the overall theme of the text?  (the future
of Saudi Arabia and plans for its development and
growth)

What assets or benefits is Saudi Arabia blessed
with? (the Two Holy Mosques, a unique geographical
location, rich natural resources, the ambition of the
people)

What are the three pillars of Saudi Arabia’s vision
for 2030? (1. The country’s status at the heart of the
Arab and Islamic worlds; 2. determination to become a
center for global business; 3. transforming the unique
geographical position into a global hub to connect 3
continents)

What themes is Saudi Arabia building its vision for
future around? (a vibrant society, a thriving economy
and an ambitious nation)

1 Big Changes10 Writing  14It all started in 1969 when a student at the University of Stanford tried to log in to a university computer, from his home in Los Angeles. This gave scientists the idea that people could communicate through computers, instead of posting letters or talking by telephone.  Many scientists researched ways to try and do this. In 1990 Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Dailliau succeeded. They created a system for people to communicate with each other and find out information using computers.  In the beginning, they called it the “Worldwide Web”. They changed the name to “The Internet” later. The Internet started with a few basic websites and e-mail. At first, it was used mainly by scientists, governments and the military. Now, more than 30 years later, there are more than four and a half billion users of the Internet (about half of the world’s population!).E-mail, instant messaging and online video calls connect people across the globe for business, education and social purposes. Social networks allow people to communicate with large numbers of friends, and upload pictures and videos to share. Information is accessible to everyone online.

a  Write areas of changes in boxes or circles on the board as students make suggestions. For example, business,

education, technology, cities, construction, science etc. Encourage students to use what they know from history,
what they have heard from different people at home or at school or what they have read.

a  Tell them to work together and make notes in the chart. They should use the questions in the chart to help them.
Elicit the kind of language that students will need to write about the changes. For example: There were smaller
buildings. There were no buildings in some areas. Now there are tall office buildings. Neighborhoods have
changed.

a  Circulate and monitor participation. After a few minutes call on one student from each group to present their

ideas to the class. Tell students to listen carefully as each group presents and then ask questions or comment.

a  Students should write their short essays individually. Encourage them to circulate their essays in their group and

have their group members comment on and correct their work.

Teaching Tip
When one student is reporting in class ask the rest of the groups/class to listen carefully and avoid repeating the same things when their turn
comes. If you think most groups will overlap on the points raised, limit the number of points that they can present. For example, ask each group to
choose 3 main points that they would like to present.
Additional Activity
Divide the class into two groups. Each group represents a different viewpoint: e.g. Group A is in favor of social networking and Group B is against
it. Give them some time to prepare their arguments and organize a debate or discussion.

a  Present to the class the form of the past progressive

tense by writing on the board:
I was sleeping…
You were sleeping…

a  Highlight the form by underlining was/were and –ing.
a  Demonstrate the function of the past progressive tense
by asking students to complete the two statements on
the board with ideas of their own.

a  Check students’ ideas and if necessary explain the

meaning of the use by giving the following example:
I was sleeping when the news broke on TV.= I was in
the middle of sleeping when something happened that
may or may not have woken me up.

Past Progressive + When + Simple Past Tense

a  Using the example(s) written on the board, circle the

word when and underline the past simple. For example,
I was sleeping when the news broke on TV.

a  Explain that we use when + simple past tense after the
past progressive when we want to show that a short
action happens in the middle of a longer action and may
or may not interrupt it. For example,
 I was sleeping when the news broke on TV. (I did not
wake up to hear the news story.)
 I was sleeping when the news broke on TV. (I woke up
to watch the news story.)

a  Explain that the clause with when can come first or last
in the sentence. For example, both of the following
sentences are correct:
I was getting off the bus when the accident happened.
When the accident happened, I was getting off the bus.
a  Point out that verbs to do with thinking and feeling are

not normally used in the progressive form. For example:
like, agree, know, want, believe, and understand.

C
a  Read the directions with the class. Remind students to

pay attention to the appropriate tense.

a  Have students work alone to make the sentences. Have
them check their answers in pairs by taking turns to
read aloud their sentences.

a  Then call on volunteers to read for the class.
a  Ask students if they believe the longer action was

interrupted by the shorter action in each sentence and
to give reasons for their answers.

1.   The people were sleeping when the earthquake happened.
2.   Fatima was going home when she saw her friend, Nawal.
3.   Majid was looking at the trees when he saw a parrot.
4.   The students were waiting for a bus when it started to rain.

D
a  Ask students to first read the paragraph and get the

general idea (the gist) by ignoring the gaps. Ask: What
is the paragraph about?

a  Students should work alone to complete the gaps and

then compare their answer with a partner.

a  Ask for a volunteer to read the completed paragraph

aloud for the class.

a  Ask students if they know of any stories of immigration
in their own families. Tell them to share their stories with
a partner.

a  Ask for volunteers to share their stories with the class.
Ask students to listen to the stories and write down
one question they would like to ask to learn more
information.

a  Write any errors with the form of the past progressive

and past simple tenses on the board. Correct the errors
as a class.

Assign pages 227–228 for more practice with the form,
meaning and function of the structures in the unit.

Teaching Tip
Activity D allows for students to identify with the language
presented in this part of the unit. By relating the language to
personal narratives and experiences, students are more likely to
retain the new structures and understand the use and meaning
more deeply. Sharing a little personal information also allows
the class to build trust and encourages students to contribute to
class discussion and facilitate learning.
Telling students every now and then something personal about
you can make the class atmosphere more relaxed. Students
will think of you not only as their teacher but someone who, like
them, has a life outside of class!
